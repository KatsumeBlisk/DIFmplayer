A folder of .pls stream files

##Use

Download streams from di.fm (or any source) and put them in a directory. The program will ask for the path to this directory.

Make the script executable, and run just like any binary.

**Optional:**

I have added a bash script to rename the files from di.fm to remove the unnecessary "Digitally Imported" from their names.
